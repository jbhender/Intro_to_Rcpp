## About this Workshop

## Why use Rcpp?

### Performance

#### Speed
**R** is an intepreted, dynamically typed language making it inherently slower than
compiled, statically typed languages such as **C++** and **C**.  Vectorization
can take you a long way in **R**, but explicit loops written in **C/C++** can
be __easier to program and read__,  __several times faster__, and sometimes both.  

#### Memory
The primary use-case for Rcpp is to reduce computation time. Sometimes improvements
in speed come from being more intelligent about memory. At other times you may 
wish to work in a compiled language in order to exercise more control over how memory is
managed. This is not the focus of this
workshop, but something you should be aware of.

#### Warning
Many **R** functions and packages have already been optimized using compiled code
written by better **C/C++** than you or I. Use these when they are available. 
Don't reinvent the wheel unless wheel design is your focus!

#### Simplicity and Familiarity

As we will see, you don't need Rcpp to use compiled code within R.  However,
Rcpp makes it convenient to do so because:
  
  + **C++** can be programmed in an 'object-oriented' much like **R** making
    it easier to translate
    
  + **Rcpp** simplifies and partially automates linking **R** and **C++**
    
  + **Rcpp** automates many common conversions between native **R** and **C++** types

While compiled code can often provide substantial improvments in computation time,
these improvements should be balanced against the time it takes you to implement them.
**Rcpp** is convenient because it allows you to work primarily in **R** and incorporate **C++**
only when you encounter a bottleneck.

#### Access to **C++** libraries

A final reason to use **Rcpp** is to make use of exisiting computational libraries 
that do something useful.

    
## Installing Rcpp

Install the **R** package `Rcpp` using, i.e. `install.packages('Rcpp')`. If working
on a remote server you may first need to point *R* to the location of your package 
library, i.e. `.libPaths('~/Rlib')`.

It will also be useful to install `RcppArmadillo`: `install.packages('RcppAramdillo')`

To use locally, you will need a C++ compiler such as `gcc`, `g++` or `clang`.  
Mac users should install Xtools from the app store.

### Using C++ libraries

C++ object classes and associated methods are defined using templates. 
These templates are generally defined in header files ending in `.h`.  For our
purposes the most important of these is: `Rcpp.h`.  To have access to the classes
defined in header files you "include" them: `#include <Rcpp.h>`.

Just as with `R` packages, we can disambiguate the source definition of a specific class
using two colons `Rcpp::IntegerVector` or `std::vector<int>`.  

### Prototyping with sourceCpp

When prototyping straightforward Rcpp functions you can use `sourceCpp()` to 
quickly compile and link **C++** functions into and active **R** session. 

Be sure to:

0. Use `#include <Rcpp.h>` to link against the Rcpp library.
1. Include `// [[Rcpp::export]]` tags to make functions visible to **R**.
2. Create tests to check that your functions work as expected.

#### Example 1

#### Error checking and exceptions 
It is good programing practice to do some error checking at the start of a
function to ensure that values passed using arguments conform to expectations. 

In **R** we often use `stop('Error message')` to raise exceptions and report errors.
In **C++** you can use the key-word `throw` with an error type such as `std::range_error('message')`
for the same purpose.  

With Rcpp there is also a shortcut function `Rcpp::stop("message about error")`. 

See this <a href='http://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/intro-to-exceptions/'> link </a>
for more on exception-handling. 

#### Printing to the console

While it is generally recommended to use a debugging tool to find errors in code,
I often debug by hand using messages printed to the console. This can be done 
using the `Rcpp::Rcout` attribute.


#### Exercises

### Using Rcpp in an R package

For all but the simplest projects in **R**, it is usually worthwhile to organize the code
base using an R package.  You can set up an empty R package use `devtools::create`.
To include Rcpp functions in an R package, place the **C++** source code in the `src` directory.
Before building or installing the package, use `Rcpp::compileAttributes()' to 
automatically generate wrappers that handle translations between **R** and **C++** types.
